  - Efficient caching system with 30-second cache duration for performance optimization.
  - Graceful fallback when configuration is not yet loaded.

* **License Management System:** Persistent license storage and validation.
  - `/oneria license give <player> <profession>` - Grant functional license with full access.
  - `/oneria license giverp <player> <profession> <expiration_date>` - Grant decorative RP-only license with no actual permissions.
  - `/oneria license revoke <player> <profession>` - Revoke license and remove from inventory.
  - `/oneria license list` - Display all licenses across all players.
  - `/oneria license list <player>` - Display licenses for specific player.
  - `/oneria license check <player> <profession>` - Verify if player has specific license.
  - Physical license items generated with custom names, lore, and profession colors.
  - Automatic license removal from inventory when revoked.
  - JSON-based persistent storage in `world/data/oneriamod/licenses.json`.

* **Profession Configuration System:** Dedicated configuration file for all profession-related settings.
  - New config file: `serverconfig/oneria-professions.toml` separate from main config.
  - Profession definitions with ID, display name, and color code (e.g., `chasseur;Chasseur;§a`).
  - Global restriction lists: `globalBlockedCrafts`, `globalUnbreakableBlocks`, `globalBlockedItems`, `globalBlockedEquipment`.
  - Profession-specific permission overrides: `professionAllowedCrafts`, `professionAllowedBlocks`, `professionAllowedItems`, `professionAllowedEquipment`.
  - Customizable restriction messages with variable support (`{item}`, `{profession}`).
  - Built-in examples for 8 professions: Hunter, Fisher, Miner, Lumberjack, Blacksmith, Alchemist, Merchant, Guard.

* **Restriction Enforcement System:** Real-time blocking of unauthorized actions.
  - Craft blocking via Mixin injection in crafting result slots.

  - Distance calculation only performed when blur system is active.
  - No additional packet modifications required.

**Configuration**

* **New Options:**
  - `enableSneakStealth` (Boolean) - Enable stealth mode for sneaking players.
    - Location: `[Obfuscation Settings]` section.
    - Default: `true`.
    - When enabled, sneaking players use reduced detection distance.

  - `sneakProximityDistance` (Integer) - Detection distance for sneaking players.
    - Location: `[Obfuscation Settings]` section.
    - Default: `2` blocks.
    - Range: 1-32 blocks.
    - Only applies when `enableSneakStealth` is enabled.

**Use Cases**

* **Stealth Roleplay:** Players can sneak to avoid being detected in crowded areas.
* **Hide and Seek:** Perfect for RP games where players need to hide.
* **Ambush Scenarios:** Players can set up surprise encounters without revealing their presence.
* **Privacy:** Players can move through areas without being immediately recognized.
* **Realistic Immersion:** Crouching for stealth mirrors real-world behavior.

**Migration Notes**

* No breaking changes - fully backward compatible with 1.1.2.
* Sneak stealth is enabled by default - disable with `/oneria config set enableSneakStealth false` if not desired.
* Existing blur system settings remain unchanged.
* Admin exemptions (`opsSeeAll`) automatically apply to sneak detection.

**Known Limitations**

* Sneak detection only affects TabList names, not physical player visibility.
